CNN training materials for off fault deformation from experiments

The zip file called 'maps and data' has the *npy maps, label and parameter data needed to train CNN and apply the trained CNN to fault maps.

The zip file called 'CNN_scripts" has '*ipynb' scripts that 1) process the maps into slices for training (Data_Processing_2023), 2) train the CNN on specific experimental maps ('Train-*') and 3) apply the trained CNN to new fault maps (Evaluate *).
